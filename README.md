# Boyer-Moore String Search Algorithm in Java

This Java program uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm to find the number of matching characters from a search string in the US States string. Spacifically the Bad Character method.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java class BoyerMooreAlgo: `javac BoyerMooreAlgo.java`
2. Combple the Main Java file: `javac Main.java`
3. Run the program: `java Main.java`

## How to Use

The program provides three options:

1. **Option 1**: Prints out a list of states in a string.
2. **Option 2**: Prompts the user to enter a string and then prints the matching number of matched characters in that pattern.
3. **Option 3**: Exits the program.

You can select an option by entering its number when prompted by the program.
